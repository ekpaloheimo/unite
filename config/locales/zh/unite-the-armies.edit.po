msgid "Total global spending on armaments is estimated at $1500 billion annually; such spending can be put into perspective by setting it alongside the estimated cost of the afforestation of the entire Sahara Desert, which would amount to about one-sixth of annual global armaments spending. This example neatly illustrates the extent of the potential needed for action in this matter, should the political will be found."
msgstr "每年全球的军力开支预计为1.5万亿美元。透视这笔开支，与之相比，为整个撒哈拉沙漠植树造林的预算成本仅占全球军力开支的六分之一。上述例证很好阐释了一旦相关政治问题得以解决，在这一问题上采取行动将有巨大的发展潜力。"
