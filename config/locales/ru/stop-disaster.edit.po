msgid "How did plastic garbage patches floating in the ocean become an object of public concern? Baptiste Monsaingeon relates the media campaigns that turned the gradual accumulation of oceanic waste from an abstract and imperceptible concern to a dire emergency requiring immediate attention."

msgid "In the next few decades only strong and effective countermeasures will be able to halt the advance of this process. We propose for your consideration the idea that global spending on armaments should be re-directed (along with other measures) to address social and environmental deterioration in a more focused manner than at present."

msgid "It is the accepted practice all round the globe that the military is called in to assist those affected by sudden and unexpected environmental disasters. It would simply be a logical extension of this to employ such a resource in counteracting the effects of large-scale and inexorably-advancing catastrophes."

msgstr ""

msgid "On a political level, it is the accepted practice everywhere that the military is called in to assist those affected by sudden and unexpected environmental disasters. It would simply be a logical extension of this practice to employ such a resource in counteracting the effects of more gradual but much larger-scale and inexorably-advancing catastrophes; this with the help, it is to be hoped, of local NGOs."

msgid "There is a hidden potential at hand: the national armies. We have to give the armies a new, positive task. In these pages we collect support to a global initiative. Save the planet. Act NOW!"

msgid "To the Secretary-General and Secretariat of the United Nations"
msgstr ""

msgid "Total global spending on armaments is estimated at $1500 billion annually; such spending can be put into perspective by setting it alongside the estimated cost of the afforestation of the entire Sahara Desert, which would amount to about one-sixth of annual global armaments spending. This example neatly illustrates the extent of the potential needed for action in this matter, should the political will be found."

msgstr ""

msgid "We propose action on projects requiring large-scale resources, both of manpower and equipment; these would include agro-forestry projects, forest, plant and animal relocations in the wake of global warming. Such projects would assist in averting the worst catastrophes; they would also aid and foster ecological and social stability, and employment at the local level, assuming the use of local labor."
